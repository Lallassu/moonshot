# Moonshot

This is my GitHubGameOff 2020 contribution.

It started out as a polished, well-structured game, but due to the lack of time, it's more of a mess now!

It has been written in Go and using its own game engine. OpenGL is used as the graphics library.

Sounds has been implemented with https://github.com/faiface/beep library.

## Build & Play

Build:
```
make build
```
Play:
```
./moonshot
```

It has currently only been tested in Linux (Ubuntu 20.04).
